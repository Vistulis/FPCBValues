Banning users from the wiki is completely unjust.

FPCB is a direct continuation of PCB rather than something completely different.

I use FCPB for fun rather than real political or economic discussion.

Reading theory is a usual pass-time for me.

Even banning the spam bots is unfair.

Griefing pages in jokey ways should be allowed.

The !Luis and similar commands for reaction images are a good addition to the server, and have been proven to not clog up chat

BERNHE's tenure as foreign minister was better than Jefbols
-5 Opposition

FPCB is as the name states Free PCB, we are the successor to the old rotten wiki.

The block button exists, 'toxic' or annoying members can be just ignored rather than having them be banned
-10 Admin

Tests like this one are stupid and meaningless and so should be combatted.
+7 Style

People saying "trve" instead of "true" annoys me extremely and so we should enforce autocorrect.
+7 Style

The "cold war" is caused by the PCB council, we just wanted to do our own thing and they have done their best to hinder us at every step.
-7 Status
+2 Opposition

The eventual end goal is to get PCB to capitulate and let the community be reunited.
+3 Status

Any attempts to at negotiation with PCB are and have proven to be futile.

Moderation needs to be increased to deal with problems like spam bots and griefing.
+6 Admin

The source documents section of FPCB is a move in the right direction, giving FPCB a more serious aspect.
+5 Style

We should have more polls like the poll on whether to add Source Documents.

Neither the Revolutionary Council nor Borker should have any authority - all should be equal.

Things without major impact but effort put into it like messardist council and Luis Miguel fan club are good for the community.
